# whereis

This project is obviously nothing more than a üç¥ from [Danielle's awesome project][dantoml]

## What is this for?

Nothing much; I liked the idea and given that it was OSS I decided to use it for me.

I'll be tweaking things here and there to give it a personal touch but in no regards I claim attribution to the idea or the implementation.
